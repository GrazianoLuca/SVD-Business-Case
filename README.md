The dataset is composed of a matrix (15,5) that represent customers' answers with regards to which aspects of the business to improve. 
The aim of the project is to derive the singular value decomposition to provide a better and simplified understanding of the customersâ€™ opininions. In the end users are classified with regards to their opinions using a similarity coefficient. The classification can also be visualised via a scatter plot.

The purpose of the project is to learn and work with an SVD in Python and R.
